Here's a concise GitHub README description for your Brain Stroke MRI Classification project:

# Brain Stroke MRI Classification using Faster R-CNN

## Project Overview
Automated machine learning project for detecting and classifying brain strokes in MRI images using Faster R-CNN object detection architecture. Leverages deep learning to provide precise stroke localization and categorization.

## Key Features
- Faster R-CNN implementation for medical image analysis
- Stroke detection and classification in MRI scans
- Studying precision sing Faster RCNN

## Technical Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Faster R-CNN
- Medical imaging libraries

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: [Insert specific percentage]
- Precision: [Insert specific percentage]
- Recall: [Insert specific percentage]

It can be seen that this model does not give very high precision or accuracy result on classification. This is because Faster RCNN was developed as a Region Proposal Technique, and not an image classification tool.This project is a study into the same.
